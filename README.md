# Work Day Scheduler 

## Project Description (Third-Party APIs)

Starter code includes a partially completed style.css & index.html files. The Script.js will need to be started from [Scratch] and include JQuery Moment.js within to create a functioning Work Day Scheduler.

The main objective is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
